Here is where the code saves grids that might be useful to reuse in the future.
At the moment we load directly the desired meshes from gmsh_grids.
So this folder is not really useful.

It is possible though, as it was done during the developement, to manipulate the grids from the code itself, with deal.ii tools.
After that, GridForge will save them here in .vtu format. 
At following run, instead of performing all those operations again, the code will look first here to see if there is something to be loaded.

To clear this directory, simply use the command
> make cleanmesh
