Here is where the code will save all the output files, namely:
- solutions at each refinement cycle
- dual solutions at each refinement cycle

Only the former have physical relevance.

Dual solutions are used implicitly in the code to perform Goal Oriented Adaptive Refinement. This outputs were a useful tool in development phase.

To empty all .vtu in this folder manually, just type:
> make cleanres
